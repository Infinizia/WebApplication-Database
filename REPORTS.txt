Task 1: Connection Pooling and Prepared Statements
- The database connection configurations is located on the \META-INF\context.xml.

- We added the database connection pooling code in the DbContext/dbConnection.java file.
  In the dbConnection.java file, when a request is needed for DB connection, it will open
  a connection by using the DataSource object to get the database connection from the backend server.

- In the \WEB-INF\web.xml, the resource-ref tag is used to allow the  dbConnection.java file to
  pull the information from the context.xml file.



Task 2: Scaling Fabflix
- For this task, we added two new resources in the context.xml file, then we retreived the data
  in the dbConnection.java by creating two DataSource object. One DataSource object is for the master sql connection.
  The other DataSource object is for the slave sql connection.
- For every request made, the master and slave database connection is chosen based on a random generator. 
  However, whenever a write request is needed, we set the request to choose the master database connection.


Task 3: Measuring the performance of Fabflix search feature


1. How/where you use connection pooling in your code(Task1)
2. Explain how to use connection pooling in the case of having two backend servers(Task2)
3. Codebase time measurement & JMeter results(3.1-3.3)
